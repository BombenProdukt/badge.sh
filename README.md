# Badger

This project is a port of the popular [badgen/badgen.net](https://github.com/badgen/badgen.net) project by [amio](https://github.com/amio). The goal of this project is to reach feature parity with the original project and expand on it, but with a few differences:

- Use [Laravel](https://laravel.com) as the framework
- Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- Use [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) for the frontend
- Leverage the Laravel ecosystem to provide a more robust and streamlined development process

## Installation

We recommend deploying the project using [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com). Usage outside of Laravel Forge is the same as any other Laravel project.

## Usage

Check [badger.preem.studio](https://badger.preem.studio) for a list of all available badges. **We accept pull requests for new badges, so if you don't see one you need, feel free to add it!**
